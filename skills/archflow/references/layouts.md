# Layout Reference

Conceptual layout guide for animated architecture diagrams.
Choose a layout based on the system's shape, then compose inline
SVG to match. See `svg-exemplar.md` for the structural pattern
and `templates/` for working HTML examples.

===================================================================
CORE PRINCIPLE — HIERARCHICAL SPATIAL COMPOSITION
===================================================================

Real systems are not flat sequences of boxes. They have grouped
subsystems, nested internals, fan-out/fan-in, and parallel paths.
Diagrams must reflect this structure spatially.

THE ANTI-PATTERN (avoid this):

```
  [A] → [B] → [C] → [D] → [E] → [F] → [G]
```

A flat row of boxes connected by arrows. This layout:
  - Shows sequence but hides structure
  - Makes every component look equally important
  - Cannot represent parallel paths or grouping
  - Becomes unreadable past 5-6 nodes

THE GOAL:

```
  ┌─────────────┐     ┌──── GROUP B ─────────┐     ┌── GROUP C ──┐
  │ [Source]     │     │  [Parser 1]          │     │  [Bronze]   │
  │   detail     │ ──> │  [Parser 2]   ──>    │ ──> │    ↓        │
  │   sub-info   │     │  [Parser 3]          │     │  [Silver]   │
  └─────────────┘     │  [+ N more types]    │     │    ↓        │
                       └──────────────────────┘     │  [Gold]     │
                                                     └─────────────┘
```

Grouped containers that:
  - Wrap related components into labeled regions
  - Show horizontal flow BETWEEN groups (left → right)
  - Show internal structure WITHIN groups (vertical stacks, grids)
  - Use depth tiers to signal hierarchy level

===================================================================
DEFAULT MEDIUM — INLINE SVG
===================================================================

Architecture diagrams are inline SVG, not CSS flex/grid or Mermaid.

SVG provides pixel-perfect control over group containers, curved
arrow paths, arrowhead markers, icon circles, and multi-line text
labels. A single <svg class="arch-svg" viewBox="..."> scales
responsively without media queries.

  → Group containers are <rect class="group-box"> with rx corners
  → Inter-group flow is <path class="arrow-path"> with Q/C curves
  → Arrowhead markers live in <defs> (default + lit variants)
  → Components inside groups are smaller <rect> elements
  → Text labels, codes, and badges are <text> elements

CSS custom properties (var(--surface), var(--border), var(--accent))
work inside SVG fill and stroke attributes — the theme toggle
applies automatically.

CSS classes on SVG elements (.group-box, .source-box, .arrow-path)
let the phase engine and theme system target them. The .lit class
activates the highlight state during phase animation.

CSS flex/grid is for NON-DIAGRAM content: card grids, stat displays,
step lists, comparison panels. Anything that shows how components
CONNECT to each other is SVG.

See svg-exemplar.md for the full structural pattern, sizing
conventions, and phase engine data structure.

===================================================================
GROUP CONTAINERS
===================================================================

A group container is a bordered/backgrounded region that wraps
related components. It replaces the flat "row of boxes" pattern.

In SVG diagrams (the default), a group container is a
<rect class="group-box"> with rounded corners (rx:8) and a
<text> label positioned near its top edge. The group visually
wraps smaller component rects inside it.

In HTML card-based layouts (non-diagram sections), the CSS pattern:

  .group {
    background: var(--surface);
    border: 1px solid var(--border);
    border-radius: 12px;
    padding: 16px;
    position: relative;
  }
  .group-label {
    position: absolute; top: -10px; left: 16px;
    background: var(--bg); padding: 0 8px;
    font-family: var(--font-mono);
    font-size: 9px; letter-spacing: 2px;
    text-transform: uppercase;
  }

When to create a group:
  → 2+ components share a runtime boundary (same process, service)
  → Components form a subsystem with a name (e.g., "ReAct Loop",
    "Lambda Parsers", "Lakeflow DLT", "Tool Ecosystem")
  → A component has internal sub-steps worth showing

Depth tiers for groups:
  → HERO:     accent-tinted border + subtle glow. Use for the
              primary subsystem (orchestrator, core loop)
  → ELEVATED: slightly lighter surface, subtle box-shadow
  → DEFAULT:  standard surface + border
  → RECESSED: darker surface, inset shadow. Use for storage,
              external services, secondary concerns

===================================================================
NESTING — COMPONENTS INSIDE GROUPS
===================================================================

Components inside a group use internal layout:

  VERTICAL STACK — for sequential internal steps
    In SVG: smaller <rect> elements at 32px height, incrementing y
    by 40px within the parent group-box coordinate space.
    In HTML: flex-direction: column; gap: 6px;
    Use when: steps happen in order (Bronze → Silver → Gold)

  HORIZONTAL WRAP — for parallel/peer items
    In SVG: rects placed side-by-side incrementing x.
    In HTML: display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 6px;
    Use when: items are peers (11 tools, 4 parsers, 6 contracts)

  GRID — for categorized items
    In SVG: rects arranged in rows and columns within the group.
    In HTML: display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(140px,1fr));
    Use when: items have categories (tools by type, entities by layer)

Components inside groups are SMALLER than top-level components:
  → In SVG: 8-9px font for labels (vs 10-11px for group labels)
  → In HTML: reduced padding (8-10px vs 14px), smaller font
  → Dashed borders/strokes for optional/conditional items

===================================================================
HORIZONTAL FLOW BETWEEN GROUPS
===================================================================

The PRIMARY flow direction is LEFT → RIGHT between groups.
Arrow connectors sit between groups, not between individual
components inside groups.

```
  [Group A] ──arrow──> [Group B] ──arrow──> [Group C]
```

In SVG, inter-group flow uses <path class="arrow-path"> elements
with curved segments (Q quadratic or C cubic commands) and
marker-end referencing arrowhead markers from <defs>. Paths
connect group bounding boxes, not individual components.

Each group handles its own internal layout. The top-level layout
only cares about arranging groups horizontally with arrows between.

For systems that don't fit in one horizontal row:

  TWO-ROW FLOW:
  ```
    [Group A] ──> [Group B] ──> [Group C]
                                    |
    [Group F] <── [Group E] <── [Group D]
  ```

  TREE / FAN-OUT:
  ```
                  ┌──> [Group B]
    [Group A] ──>├──> [Group C]  ──> [Group E]
                  └──> [Group D]
  ```

===================================================================
FLOW SPINE
===================================================================

The flow spine is the single primary data path from entry to exit —
the "storyline" a viewer traces to understand the system. Every
diagram must have exactly one spine.

  ONE SPINE PER DIAGRAM:
    Left-to-right reading order. If you cannot trace arrows from
    entry to exit, the diagram lacks a spine and needs rework.

  EVERY GROUP ON THE SPINE OR CONNECTED TO IT:
    Spine groups sit on the main data path (entry → processing →
    output). Non-spine groups (tools, storage, external services)
    connect to a spine group via branch arrows. No group floats
    without a connection.

  BRANCHES ARE SUBORDINATE:
    Fan-out, loops, side-calls, and storage access are secondary
    paths. Position them below or above the spine line, at a
    recessed depth tier. They visually defer to the spine.

  SPINE DETERMINES PHASE ORDER:
    The phase engine walks the spine from entry to exit. Phase 0 =
    entry/trigger. Each subsequent phase = next spine group + the
    arrow leading to it. Branch phases interleave right after their
    parent spine group — never appended at the end.

  ANTI-PATTERN CLARIFICATION:
    The [A] → [B] → [C] warning (see CORE PRINCIPLE above) is about
    ungrouped flat boxes with no internal structure — NOT about
    sequential flow. A spine connects GROUPS that contain rich
    internal layouts. Sequential clarity and structural depth coexist.

  ```
    SPINE:
      [Entry] ──> [Group A] ──> [Group B] ──> [Output]
                       │              │
    BRANCHES:     [Storage]      [Services]
  ```

  SPINE SPACING DISCIPLINE:
    Spine groups sit in a horizontal row with dedicated arrow gaps
    between them. No group should touch or overlap its neighbor.

    Minimum gap between spine groups: 40px. This gap is reserved
    for the arrow path — nothing else occupies it.

    Branch groups sit in a row BELOW the spine (or above, for
    lightweight elements). The vertical gap between spine bottom
    edge and branch top edge must be at least 30px — enough for
    arrow routing without collision.

    When branch arrows need to reach a non-adjacent spine group,
    route them through the gap space below (or above) the spine
    row — never through an intervening group.

===================================================================
LAYOUT A — HORIZONTAL PIPELINE (with groups)
===================================================================

Use when:
  - API services, RAG systems, request/response flows
  - Data has a clear left-to-right path
  - External services feed into one processing layer

Shape (grouped):

```
  ┌── INPUT ──┐     ┌── ORCHESTRATION ────────┐     ┌── OUTPUT ──┐
  │ [User]    │     │ [Router]               │     │ [Response] │
  │  query     │ ──> │ [Processor]            │ ──> │  formatted │
  │  context   │     │ [Validator]            │     └────────────┘
  └────────────┘     │   ↓ calls              │
                      │ ┌─ SERVICES ─────────┐│
                      │ │ DB · API · Cache   ││
                      │ └────────────────────┘│
                      └────────────────────────┘
```

Key difference from flat pipeline: the orchestration group
CONTAINS its service dependencies as a nested sub-group,
rather than having services float below as a separate row.

## Layout B — Multi-Agent Hub (with groups)

Use when:
  - Orchestrator spawns parallel workers or sub-agents
  - ReAct loops, multi-agent systems, fan-out / fan-in patterns

Shape (grouped):

```
  ┌── ENTRY ──┐     ┌═══ REACT LOOP (hero border) ═══════════════┐

                     └═════════════════════════════════════════════┘
                                        |
                     ┌── GROUNDING ─────────────────────┐
                     │ [Ledger]    grounded_tables: set  │
                     │  anti-hallucination    columns    │
                     │  entity verification   measures   │
                     └──────────────────────────────────┘
                                        |

                     └──────────────────────────────────┘
```

The ReAct loop is the HERO group (accent border, glow).
Tools, prompt sections, and iteration steps are nested groups
inside it. The grounding ledger and evaluator are separate
groups below, connected by vertical arrows.

---

## Layout C — Medallion Pipeline (with groups)

Use when:
  - ETL / ELT systems, Databricks, Delta Live Tables
  - Staged data transformations with distinct processors per stage

Shape (grouped):

```
  ┌── SOURCE ────┐     ┌── PARSERS ──────────┐     ┌── LAKEFLOW DLT ──┐
  │ [TSYS Files] │     │ [ADF]  5-level      │     │ [Bronze]          │
  │  Fixed-Width │     │ [MDI]  PII masking   │     │  39 streaming     │
  │  COBOL       │ ──> │ [TDDF] dual-sign    │ ──> │     ↓             │
  │              │     │ [D256] overpunch     │     │ [Silver]          │
  │  SFTP Daily  │     │                      │     │  7 quality tables │
  └──────────────┘     │ + 32 new file types  │     │     ↓             │
                        └──────────────────────┘     │ [Gold]           │
                                                      │  4 materialized  │
                                                      └──────────────────┘
```

Each stage is a GROUP containing its internal components stacked
vertically. The arrow flow is between groups, not between
individual components. Internal components show detail (counts,
types, descriptions) that a flat node could not fit.

---

## Component Detail Cards

Inside a group, each component can show structured detail:

```
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ 🔄  ReAct Loop Engine   [_run_loop()]  [MAX=20]    │
  │                                                      │
  │  Each iteration: LLM Call → Parse JSON → Execute     │
  │  Tools → Track Grounding → Validate Contracts        │
  │                                                      │
  │  ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌───────────┐           │
  │  │ LLM Call │ │ Parse    │ │ Execute   │  ...       │
  │  │ GPT-5.2  │ │ Response │ │ Tools     │           │
  │  └──────────┘ └──────────┘ └───────────┘           │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Structure:
  → Icon + Name + Tag badges (inline, top row)
  → Description paragraph (1-2 lines)
  → Internal sub-items as small wrapped cards (optional)

This is how the visual-explainer achieves information density:
each component card is a mini-layout with icon, title, tags,
description, AND nested sub-items — not just a label in a box.

---

## Vertical Connector Alignment

The single most common visual bug in generated diagrams is
misaligned vertical connectors.

In SVG diagrams, connector alignment is handled by path coordinates
and is inherently pixel-precise — no flex mirroring needed. Use
exact x,y values in path d attributes.

In HTML+CSS layouts, one rule prevents misalignment:

**The connector row must replicate the flex structure of the row
it connects to.**

Equal-width rows (e.g., agent cards with flex:1 and gap:12px):
  - Connector row uses the same flex:1 children and gap:12px
  - Each child centers a vert-line element

Mixed-width rows (e.g., component + arrow-col alternating):
  - Connector row replicates each slot's min-width or flex value
  - Arrow-col slots become empty spacers with matching flex/max-width

Never:
  - Use fixed px gaps to align with flex:1 cards
  - Use justify-content:flex-end with padding to eyeball alignment
  - Omit gap from connector rows when the adjacent row has gap

---

## Composition Rules

Vary visual density across the report so no two adjacent sections
feel the same:

  - **Full-width**: hero diagram, key metrics banner
  - **Split-panel**: two-column compare (e.g., before/after, pros/cons)
  - **Grid**: 3-4 concept cards or entity summaries
  - **Single-column**: narrative text, detailed explanations

The architecture diagram is the HERO section — an inline SVG
element with full width and max-height:70vh. Give it maximum
visual weight: generous padding, animated phase highlights,
radial gradient backgrounds. Surrounding sections should be
lighter so the diagram commands attention.

### Diagram density quick-reference

| System shape                        | Recommended layout                          |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 4-7 linear layers                   | 3-4 groups flowing horizontally             |
| 8+ layers or nested sub-components  | Groups with internal vertical stacks        |
| Hub-spoke with 2-4 agents           | Hub group + agent cards inside              |
| Hub-spoke with 5+ agents            | Hub group + agent grid inside               |
| Staged transforms (ETL/medallion)   | Stage groups flowing left → right           |
| Complex system (loops, eval gates)  | Hero group (core loop) + satellite groups   |

## Templates Reference

The `templates/` directory contains working HTML examples for each
layout. Use them to understand the CSS class vocabulary (component,
arrow-col, arrow-line, shimmer, vert-line, storage-pipeline, etc.)
and the phase-engine ID conventions (litComponent, litArrow,
litStorage target elements by ID regardless of layout direction).

Templates are EXAMPLES of how to implement these concepts — not
rigid structures to copy verbatim. Adapt the shape, density, and
component count to fit the specific system being diagrammed.

**Important**: Templates show flat layouts for simplicity. In
practice, ALWAYS apply the hierarchical grouping principles above.
Group related components into containers. Nest sub-items inside
component cards. Use depth tiers to signal hierarchy. The flat
template patterns are building blocks — the grouped composition
is the goal.
