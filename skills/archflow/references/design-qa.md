# Design Quality Gates

Visual quality checklist and anti-patterns for all archflow outputs.
Run through these checks mentally before finalizing any generated HTML.

===================================================================
PRE-GENERATION: THINK PHASE
===================================================================

Before writing HTML, commit to a visual direction:

  1. What is the project's character?
     → Data engineering / ETL     → IBM Plex Sans, cool blues
     → AI / ML / agents          → DM Sans, warm oranges + purples
     → Enterprise / API          → Outfit, clean geometric
     → Developer tooling         → Bricolage Grotesque, bold greens

  2. Which palette family fits?
     → Default (cyan/orange/purple) for technical systems
     → Warm Signal (teal/terracotta/amber) for data platforms
     → Nordic (ice-blue/slate/frost-green) for enterprise
     → Terminal (neon-green/hot-pink/electric-blue) for dev tools

  3. Which atmosphere?
     → Radial glow for most outputs
     → Dot grid for minimal / enterprise
     → Gradient mesh for data-heavy / editorial

  Do NOT default to the same font + palette + atmosphere every time.
  Each project should feel intentionally designed, not template-stamped.

===================================================================
SQUINT TEST
===================================================================

Blur the page to 50% in your mind. Can you still distinguish:

  → The header from the body?
  → The hero diagram from surrounding sections?
  → KPI cards from insight cards?
  → The TOC sidebar from the main content?

If everything blurs into one uniform column, you need more
visual hierarchy. Fix with:

  → Vary card depth tiers (hero, elevated, recessed, glass)
  → Use full-width sections alternating with grid sections
  → Make the diagram section visually heavier than others
  → Use accent color stripes to break monotony

===================================================================
SWAP TEST
===================================================================

Mentally replace the accent colors with a different palette.
Does the design still work?

  → If hierarchy depends on a specific color, it's fragile.
  → Hierarchy should come from SIZE, WEIGHT, DEPTH, and SPACE —
    not from color alone.
  → Color reinforces hierarchy; it should never be the only signal.

===================================================================
DEPTH VARIETY CHECK
===================================================================

Every report must use at least 3 different card depth tiers:

  ✓ af-card--hero      → Executive summary, key finding
  ✓ af-card--elevated  → Insights, service cards, important content
  ✓ af-card (base)     → Standard content cards
  ✓ af-card--recessed  → Component table wrapper, code references
  ✓ af-card--glass     → Special callouts (use sparingly, max 1 per report)

  BAD:  Every section uses the same flat af-card
  GOOD: Overview is --hero, insights are --elevated, code refs are --recessed

===================================================================
ACCENT COLOR VARIETY
===================================================================

Never give all cards in a section the same accent color.

  BAD:  4 insight cards, all with af-card--accent-cyan
  GOOD: Insight 1: cyan, Insight 2: orange, Insight 3: green, Insight 4: purple

  BAD:  3 service cards, all with af-card--accent-yellow
  GOOD: Service cards use the color matching their role:
        Database → yellow, API → cyan, Cache → green, Queue → orange

  The semantic color assignments from the design system guide this:
    Cyan    → input / client / user-facing
    Orange  → orchestrator / coordinator
    Purple  → agents / workers / processing
    Yellow  → storage / external services
    Green   → output / success / persistence
    Amber   → LLM / AI inference
    Blue    → API / app layer

===================================================================
LAYOUT RHYTHM
===================================================================

Sections should NOT all be the same width and layout.
Create visual rhythm by alternating:

  → Full-width hero card (overview)
  → Multi-column grid (KPIs: 4-col, services: 3-col, insights: 2-col)
  → Full-width diagram (no card wrapper, maximum visual weight)
  → Table (full-width, recessed card wrapper)
  → Asymmetric first item (first insight full-width, rest 2-col)

  BAD:  Every section is a single full-width card, stacked vertically
  GOOD: Overview (full-width hero) → KPIs (4-col grid) → Diagram (full-width, no card)
        → Table (recessed) → Services (3-col grid) → Insights (asymmetric)

===================================================================
ANIMATION CHOREOGRAPHY
===================================================================

Don't use the same animation for everything. Match animation type
to element role — each role has a reason for its entrance style:

  Element Role          Animation         Why
  Hero heading          fadeUp            classic entrance, draws the eye down
  Stat numbers          fadeScale         scale catches the eye on important data
  Section cards         fadeUp            consistent, expected
  KPI badges/tags       fadeScale         pops in, feels dynamic
  Pull-quotes           none (or slow fade) calm, editorial, not bouncy
  Metric strip cells    fadeUp + stagger  left-to-right reveal reads like data
  Diagram               none              phase engine handles it
  Tables                fadeUp (subtle)   minimal distraction for reference content
  Terminal blocks       fadeUp            single entrance, no internal animation

  Entrance Type         Timing
  fadeUp                0.4s ease-out
  fadeScale             0.35s ease-out
  countUp (CSS)         1.2s ease-out

  Stagger: use --i increments of 0.06-0.08s.
  Important elements get lower --i values (appear first).

  Section reveal: use IntersectionObserver so sections animate
  when scrolled into view, not all at page load.

===================================================================
TYPOGRAPHY ANTI-PATTERNS
===================================================================

  NEVER use as the primary body font:
    → Inter
    → Roboto
    → Arial
    → Helvetica
    → system-ui alone (as sole font-family)

  These signal "AI-generated default" and lack character.

  ALWAYS use at least 2 DISTINCT font families (not from the same family):
    → Instrument Serif (display) + DM Sans (body) + Fira Code (mono)
    → Playfair Display (display) + Inter (body) + JetBrains Mono (mono)
    → Fraunces (display) + IBM Plex Sans (body) + IBM Plex Mono (mono)
    → Bebas Neue (display) + Outfit (body) + Space Mono (mono)
    → Bricolage Grotesque (display) + Plus Jakarta Sans (body) + Azeret Mono (mono)

  NEVER use one font family for everything (e.g., Red Hat Display + Red Hat Mono).
  Mix serif display with sans-serif body for editorial contrast.
  Add a third voice: editorial serif (Newsreader, Crimson Pro) for quotes/callouts.

  Rotate pairings across projects. Don't always pick the same set.

===================================================================
COLOR ANTI-PATTERNS
===================================================================

  NEVER:
    → Use the same accent color for all cards in a grid
    → Use gradient text on headings
    → Use animated glowing shadows (archflow's phase engine glow
      is the ONE exception — it's functional, not decorative)
    → Apply neon intensity to body text backgrounds

  ALWAYS:
    → Use semantic color assignments consistently
    → Ensure text on colored backgrounds has sufficient contrast
    → Keep accent colors at 8-12% opacity for card tint backgrounds
    → Use full-strength accents only for borders, labels, and dots

===================================================================
FINAL CHECKLIST — RUN BEFORE PRESENTING
===================================================================

  □ Squint test passes (sections visually distinct when blurred)
  □ Swap test passes (hierarchy works without color alone)
  □ Typography uses 2+ distinct font families (serif + sans or display + body)
  □ No single font family for display + body + labels
  □ Each section has a UNIQUE background treatment (gradient, texture, or atmosphere)
  □ No uniform flat background across all sections
  □ No 3+ adjacent sections with the same card/component shape
  □ At least 3 different component types used (not all bordered rectangles)
  □ Accent colors varied (not monochrome grid)
  □ Background atmosphere matches project character
  □ Diagram phase engine runs correctly
  □ Both dark and light themes work
  □ Sections reveal on scroll (not all at once)
  □ No overflow on mobile viewport
  □ Phase banner is readable in both themes
  □ If you swapped CSS between this report and another, someone WOULD notice

===================================================================
STRUCTURED REVIEW PROTOCOL
===================================================================

After generating the output HTML, re-read the file and validate
each category below. Report findings with severity levels.

This protocol is used by the REVIEW stage (Stage 5) of the
archflow pipeline. Run every check. Report each as ✓, ⚠, or ✗
with a brief note.

  Category         What to check                                     Severity if failed

  Layout rhythm    No 3+ adjacent sections with same shape            WARNING
  Backgrounds      Each section has unique background treatment       ERROR
  HTML validity    No unclosed tags, no missing >, no broken nesting   CRITICAL

  Theme toggle     CSS custom properties used (not hardcoded colors)  WARNING
  Accessibility    prefers-reduced-motion rule present                WARNING

  How to verify each check:

    Typography     Count distinct font-family declarations. Must be ≥2
                   distinct families (not variants of the same family).

    Palette        Count unique accent colors used on cards/borders.
                   Must be ≤4. Check semantic consistency (cyan=input, etc.).

    Depth tiers    Count distinct card depth classes or shadow levels.
                   Must be ≥3 (e.g., hero, elevated, recessed).

    Color variety  In any card grid (3+ cards), check that not all cards
                   share the same accent color.

    Layout rhythm  Scan section layouts top-to-bottom. Flag if 3+
                   adjacent sections use the same card/component shape.

    Backgrounds    Each <section> must have a visually distinct background
                   (gradient, texture, color, or atmosphere). No two adjacent
                   sections should share the same flat background.

    HTML validity  Scan every opening tag (<section, <div, <rect, <text,
                   <path, <svg, etc.). Verify each has a closing >.
                   Check that block elements (<section>, <div>, <article>)
                   have matching closing tags. Look for attributes that end
                   with a quote but no > before the next tag. This is the
                   most damaging defect — a single missing > can collapse
                   entire sections and make content render unstyled.

    SVG structure  Every <g> group in the SVG must be connected by at least
                   one arrow. No orphan groups floating disconnected.

    SVG text fit   For each <text> inside a <rect>, estimate text width
                   (chars × ~8.5px for 14px font, ~10px for 16px). Compare
                   to rect width minus padding (16px each side). Flag if
                   text may overflow.

    SVG label clash For each flow label (<text> between groups), check that:
                   - The label's x position is fully inside the gap between
                     the source group's right edge and the target group's
                     left edge. Estimate label half-width as (chars × font-size
                     × 0.3) for text-anchor="middle".
                   - The label's y position does not coincide with an arrow's
                     y coordinate at the same x range (labels should sit
                     above or below the arrow, not on top of it).
                   - No label overlaps a group-box or source-box border.
                   This is the most common SVG defect — inter-group gaps
                   that are too narrow for the label text they contain.

    SVG arrows     Trace each arrow path. It must connect two boxes that
                   have a data-flow relationship. No arrows should cross
                   over unrelated boxes without routing around them.

    Animation      Check that the phase engine's phase definitions cover
                   every component group. Each group must be highlighted
                   in at least one phase.

    Theme toggle   Search for hardcoded color values (#hex, rgb(), hsl())
                   outside of CSS custom property definitions. All color
                   usage should reference var(--*) properties.

    Accessibility  Search for @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce).
                   Must be present with animation/transition overrides.

  VERDICT RULES:
    PASS              → 0 CRITICAL, 0 ERROR
    CONDITIONAL PASS  → 0 CRITICAL, 0 ERROR, WARNINGs only
    FAIL              → any CRITICAL or ERROR → trigger FIX stage (Stage 6)
